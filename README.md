## What is Exercism.org?

[Exercism.org](https://exercism.org) is an open-source platform that offers a unique and practical approach to learning programming languages. It provides a supportive community and a structured curriculum to help you improve your coding skills through hands-on exercises.

## Projects on Exercism.org

Exercism.org offers a wide range of programming language tracks, each of which contains multiple projects or exercises designed to challenge and deepen your understanding of the language. Here's what you can expect from the projects on Exercism:

### 1. **Language Proficiency**

Exercism projects are specifically designed to teach you a particular programming language. You'll start with simple exercises to get a feel for the syntax and gradually move on to more complex challenges as you become more proficient.

### 2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

A fundamental skill in software development is writing code that works as expected. Exercism emphasizes Test-Driven Development (TDD), where you write tests first and then implement the code to make those tests pass. This approach helps you write reliable and maintainable code.

### 3. **Community Feedback**

After you submit your solution, experienced mentors and fellow learners provide feedback on your code. This feedback is invaluable for learning best practices, improving your code quality, and gaining insights into alternative approaches.

### 4. **Iterative Learning**

Exercism encourages you to iterate on your solutions. You can submit multiple iterations and improve your code based on feedback. This iterative process helps you internalize concepts and grow as a programmer.

### 5. **Real-World Relevance**

The exercises often mirror real-world programming scenarios. This means that the skills you acquire on Exercism are directly transferable to professional software development.

### 6. **Diverse Programming Languages**

Exercism offers a variety of programming language tracks, from popular languages like Python, JavaScript, and Java to more specialized languages like Rust, Elixir, and Clojure. You can explore and learn multiple languages at your own pace.

### 7. **Gamified Learning**

Exercism makes learning fun by gamifying the process. You earn achievements, badges, and progress through levels as you complete exercises, making your learning journey engaging and rewarding.

### 8. **Free and Open Source**

Exercism.org is a nonprofit organization committed to making learning resources freely accessible to everyone. All the content, exercises, and platform features are available for free.
